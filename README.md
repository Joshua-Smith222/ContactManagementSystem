Hi and welcome to my Contact Management System mini project!
First step once you have accessed the program is to run the required txt file for making sure you have access to phonenumbers library. Use this command to intall the required txt file :
pip install -r requirements.txt
Next you can run the program through the terminal a menu should pop up like so:
Welcome to the Contact Management System!
Menu:
1. Add a new contact
2. Edit an existing contact
3. Delete a contact
4. Search for a contact
5. Display all contacts
6. Export contacts to a text file
7. Import contacts from a text file (BONUS)
8. Quit
Please select an option (1-8):
Feel free to explore and play around with the features.
For options 6 and 7 to work correctly try establishing a few contacts using option 1 first then selecting option 6 which should export those newly made contacts into a txt file. From there if you kill the terminal or system by selecting option 8 when starting the program again selecting option 7 will import all the contacts you have exported back in.
